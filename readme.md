<h1>What is this Project about?</h1>
This project will include basic uses of dictionaries, lists and set. The user will input the names of their class members that they teach or are grading, and then enter their grade which they achieved (A-F). Then it will ask the user if they want to see what class members got a specific grade, output their names and how many total there are out of all members in the class.
