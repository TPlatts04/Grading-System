<h1>What is this Project about?</h1>
This project will include basic uses of dictionaries, lists and set. The user will input the names of their class members that they teach or are grading, and then enter their grade which they achieved (A-F). Then it will ask the user if they want to see what class members got a specific grade, output their names and how many total there are out of all members in the class.

<h1>Time to complete</h1>
This project had taken me just under 1.5hrs to complete, I spent a good 5 minutes looking at git commands to refresh myself on git. This project took me by surprise considering i am new to Python and how easy it was, i did have one hiccup where i didn't know Python's version of JavaScript's switch/case statements and it's default statement. However, i quickly figured this out and it was easy enough to learn.<br>
This project was actually a thought of my own, i did not use any AI to help me with ideas. I am proud of what the outcome of this project is and excited to learn more of Python!
